    <h1>The Best Series according to Jayesh</h1>
    <h3> [P.S. : I am not a great fan of movies]</h3>
    <hr>
    <h2>
        My top 3 shows of all time
    </h2>
    <br>
    <h3>
        1. Money Heist
    </h3>
    <p>It is absolutely amazing becuase it is story of a group of losers who fuck the entire Intelligencce, Army and
        police of a country. This is the type of seriess which could hold my attention and keep maintaining that. I was
        never bored of this series. I can watch it all day long</p>
    <br>
    <h3>
        2. Diplomat
    </h3>
    <p>I really like the life of a diplomat and this series is just that. It also has a lot of twists and turns and
        "WTF" moments in it which makes it more intriuging.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>
        3. Breaking Bad
    </h3>
    <p>It is a story of how chemistry can make a man one of the greatest ganster the mafia world has ever seen</p>
